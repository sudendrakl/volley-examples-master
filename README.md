#Volley Examples
A set of examples on using Volley's ImageLoader and creating a Http request that returns json data parsed by Gson. 

The application is wired up using [Dagger](https://github.com/square/dagger)(dependency injection) and [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) as the Http Client.
